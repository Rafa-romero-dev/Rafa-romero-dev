<h2>🚀 About me</h2>
<h4 align="center"> I'm a Software Developer with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering that loves coding and building exciting things, I also consider myself to be a fan of UX and DX. The technologies I enjoy and I handle the most are all JS-related, I try to build little projects from time to time with tools or libraries that I consider interesting. If you have an interesting project, a job proposal or open source project I'm all for it. Just reach out to me at any of my social links.</h4>
